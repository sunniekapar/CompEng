# Welcome to CompEng!

## What is CompEng?

CompEng is my first front-end React project. The purpose of this project is to further develop my React skills and grasp the fundamentals of reusable components and responsive web design.

## Here are some of the libraries I used:

- recharts: https://github.com/recharts/recharts
- react-reveal: https://github.com/morellodev/react-awesome-reveal
- tailwind-animated: https://github.com/new-data-services/tailwindcss-animated
- shadcn/ui: https://ui.shadcn.com
- tailwind-scollbar: https://github.com/adoxography/tailwind-scrollbar
